## Project Background
I used VBA scripting to analyzed gerenated data of the stock market. For each year, I had to go find the ticker symbol, calculate the quarterly and percent change from opening price to closing price, and the total stock volume. In addition, I had to find the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and the greatest total volume. 

## Data 
Data was provided as a practice. The script works for multiple worksheet in one workbook. The number for rows for each sheet were as follow:
<br>- <b>2018:</b> 753000 rows
<br>- <b>2019:</b> 756000 rows
<br>- <b>2020:</b> 756000 rows

## Screenshot 
If you would like to see a screenshot for each year, you can find a snipet of it in the pdf file.
