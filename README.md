## Project Background
I used VBA scripting to analyzed gerenated data of the stock market. For each year, I had to go find the ticker symbol, calculate the quarterly change and percent change from opening price to closing price, and the total stock volume. In addition to the changes, any change below $0 were marked as red, and anything => $0 were marked green. At the top of each sheet is the stock that the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and the greatest total volume. 

## Data 
Data was provided for practice. The script works for multiple worksheet in one workbook. The number for rows for each sheet were as follow:
<br>- <b>2018:</b> 753000 rows
<br>- <b>2019:</b> 756000 rows
<br>- <b>2020:</b> 756000 rows


## Screenshot 
If you would like to see a screenshot for each year, you can find a snipet of it in the pdf file.
